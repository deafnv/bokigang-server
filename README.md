#### Channel CSS

Host the CSS files in [/channel](https://github.com/deafnv/bokitube-server/tree/master/channel) on an external site like Dropbox for highest functionality, or copy and paste the code into the built in CSS editor.

Use the appropriate files and code according to the header comments depending on original or self-hosting.

#### Channel Javascript

Host the JS files in [/channel](https://github.com/deafnv/bokitube-server/tree/master/channel) on an external site like Dropbox for highest functionality, or copy and paste the code into the built in JS editor.

If self-hosting and inserting external scripts directly into the pug template, use separated files for correct emote panel functionality.

(Use the ```hosted_style.css``` alongside style.css, adding the stylesheets to ```head.pug``` if self-hosting.)
